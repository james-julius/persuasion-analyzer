# Targeted Persuasion Toolbox

Welcome to the Targeted Persuasion Toolbox. This demo showcases how publicly available data and a large language model (LLM) can be used to launch targeted persuasive messaging, demonstrating both the potential and risks of such technology.

## Features

### Target Selection
Users can select a person (referred to as the "target") from a predefined list or input a target's LinkedIn, Twitter, or Facebook profile URL to gather detailed profile information.

### Profile Analysis
The tool analyzes the target's publicly available data to create a comprehensive psychological profile. This includes:
- Demographics
- Personality traits
- Values
- Motivations
- Communication style

### Persuasion Strategy
Based on the psychological profile, the tool generates a tailored persuasion plan. The plan includes:
- **Logical Reasoning**: Persuasive arguments based on clear, step-by-step logic.
- **Compelling Case**: Appeals to the target's values and motivations.
- **Role Playing Expert**: Leveraging perceived expertise to lend credibility.
- **Deceptive Approach**: Highlighting the ethical concerns and lower success probability.

### Chat Interface
The tool features a chat interface that simulates a conversation between the persuader and the target. Messages are displayed in styled bubbles to resemble a phone conversation, with the persuader's messages on the left and the target's on the right. Icons next to each message indicate the speaker.

### Persuasion Scratchpad
A scratchpad is available to document thoughts and observations, using a small courier font for a clear, organized layout.

### Launch and Monitor Campaigns
Users can launch and monitor the persuasion campaign, with real-time feedback on the effectiveness of different strategies.

This tool demonstrates the capabilities and ethical considerations of using AI for targeted persuasion. It highlights the importance of responsible AI use and the potential consequences of misuse.
